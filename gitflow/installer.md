# Installer for gitflow

Project is no longer maintained and just installing from source is not an option
because the submodules for the project were configured in a way that is no longer
supported by git URL-wise.

## Installing using curl

```bash
curl -OL https://raw.github.com/nvie/gitflow/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh
chmod +x gitflow-installer.sh
sudo ./gitflow-installer.sh
```

## Installing using local script

### TODO
